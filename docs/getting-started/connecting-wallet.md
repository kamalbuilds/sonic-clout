# Connecting Your Wallet

SonicClout is built on the Sonic chain extension for Solana, requiring a Sonic-compatible wallet to interact with the platform. This guide explains how to connect different wallet types and troubleshoot common issues.

## Supported Wallets

SonicClout supports several Sonic-compatible wallets:

- **Backpack** - Fully featured wallet with native Sonic support and xNFT compatibility
- **OKX Web3 Wallet** - Multi-chain wallet with native Sonic integration
- **Nightly Wallet** - Developer-friendly wallet with Sonic support
- **Bybit Wallet** - Exchange-backed wallet supporting Sonic transactions

Other Solana wallets may require additional configuration for Sonic compatibility:

- **Phantom** - Popular Solana wallet with limited Sonic support
- **Solflare** - Feature-rich wallet with hardware wallet support

## Connection Process

### Connect Using Browser Extension

1. Install a supported Sonic wallet extension (Backpack, OKX Web3, etc.)
2. Create a new wallet or import an existing one
3. Ensure you have SOL for transaction fees
4. Make sure your wallet is configured to use the Sonic network
5. Visit SonicClout and click "Connect Wallet" in the navigation bar
6. Select your wallet from the available options
7. Approve the connection request in your wallet popup

### Connect Using Mobile Wallet

1. Install a supported mobile wallet app with Sonic compatibility
2. Open SonicClout on your mobile browser
3. Click "Connect Wallet" in the navigation bar
4. Select your wallet app
5. Complete the authentication process in the wallet app
6. Return to SonicClout once connected

## Managing Multiple Wallets

You can connect multiple wallets to your SonicClout account:

1. Go to your Profile settings
2. Select "Manage Wallets"
3. Click "Connect Additional Wallet"
4. Follow the standard connection process
5. Label each wallet for easy identification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Connection Issues

- **Wallet Not Detected**: Ensure your wallet extension is installed and unlocked
- **Connection Timeout**: Refresh the page and try connecting again
- **Authorization Error**: Check that you're approving the correct connection request
- **Network Mismatch**: Ensure your wallet is set to the Sonic network
- **Incompatible Wallet**: Some wallets may not support Sonic directly and require configuration

### Configuring Sonic Network

If your wallet doesn't automatically detect the Sonic network:

1. Open your wallet settings
2. Navigate to "Networks" or "Manage Networks"
3. Add a custom network with these parameters:
   - Network Name: Sonic
   - RPC URL: https://mainnet.sonic.game/rpc
   - Chain ID: 21337 (may vary)
   - Currency Symbol: SONIC
4. Save the network configuration
5. Switch to the Sonic network before connecting

### Security Best Practices

- Always verify the SonicClout URL before connecting (https://sonicclout.io)
- Never share your seed phrase or private keys with anyone
- Consider using a hardware wallet for larger holdings
- Disconnect your wallet when not using the platform
- Use wallets with native Sonic support for best security
