# Content Tokenization

Content tokenization is a core feature of SonicClout that allows creators to transform their social content into tradable tokens on the Sonic blockchain. This guide explains how the tokenization process works and how to create your own content tokens.

## What is Content Tokenization?

Content tokenization refers to the process of creating a digital token that represents a piece of content. On SonicClout, this is achieved using the Token Factory program on the Sonic chain extension for Solana.

Benefits include:
- Monetize your content directly through token value
- Create scarcity and exclusivity
- Enable fans to invest in your content's success
- Build a community around your content
- Unlock additional DeFi opportunities
- Leverage Sonic's high-throughput, low-fee infrastructure

## How It Works

The SonicClout content tokenization process:

1. **Content Creation**: You create and upload content to SonicClout
2. **Token Configuration**: You set parameters like supply, name, and symbol
3. **On-Chain Registration**: Your content is registered via the Token Factory program on Sonic
4. **Token Distribution**: Tokens are distributed according to your configuration
5. **Market Creation**: A liquidity pool is created for trading your tokens

## Token Factory Program

The Token Factory program is an Anchor program on the Sonic blockchain that handles the creation and management of content tokens. It allows for:

- Creating new tokens with metadata
- Setting token parameters (supply, name, symbol)
- Charging a mint fee for token creation
- Tracking token creation with a counter
- Benefiting from Sonic's high transaction throughput

## Creating Your First Content Token

### Prerequisites

- A Sonic-compatible wallet (Backpack, OKX Web3, Nightly, etc.)
- SOL tokens for gas fees (significantly lower on Sonic than on Solana mainnet)
- Creator account on SonicClout
- Content ready for tokenization

### Step-by-Step Process

1. Navigate to your Profile and click "Create Content"
2. Upload your content (image, video, text, etc.)
3. Provide basic content details:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Tags
4. Configure token parameters:
   - Token Name (e.g., "My Awesome Content")
   - Token Symbol (e.g., "MAC")
   - Total Supply (how many tokens to create)
   - Decimal Places (usually 9 for Sonic tokens)
5. Review the tokenization details, including any fees
6. Confirm the creation by approving the transaction in your Sonic wallet
7. Wait for on-chain confirmation (usually a few seconds on Sonic)

### After Tokenization

Once your content is tokenized:
- You'll receive the initial token supply in your wallet
- Your content will be listed in the SonicClout marketplace
- Users can buy, sell, and trade your tokens
- You can establish liquidity pools for your tokens
- You can set up vesting schedules based on social metrics
- Your tokens are available across the Sonic ecosystem

## Advanced Features

### Token Metadata

Each content token includes metadata:
- **Content Type**: The type of content (post, image, video, etc.)
- **Content Hash**: A unique identifier for the content
- **Creator Address**: The wallet address of the creator
- **Creation Date**: When the token was created
- **Sonic Chain ID**: Identifies the token as part of the Sonic ecosystem

### Token Utilities

Content tokens can be used for:
- Access to exclusive content
- Governance voting rights
- Staking for rewards
